<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers -- a numerator, the top part, and the denominator, the bottom part.  The value of a rational number is the numerator divided by the denominator.
</p><p>
Rational numbers are a superset of binary and decimal numbers, and a subset of real numbers.  This is because some rational numbers can't be expressed exactly as a decimal number (for example, 1/3), and some other real numbers, such as pi, are impossible to make into a rational number.
</p><p>

Some programming languages have built-in support for rational numbers or support for them is included in their standard libraries, such as Python and Ruby.
</p><p>
<h2>  
Detailed Semantics
</h2>
<p>
A rational number in CBOR has the tag 30 and consists of an array with a length of 2.  The first element is the numerator, and the second is the denominator.  The numerator must be a positive integer (major type 0), a negative integer (major type 1), or a bignum (major type 6, tag 2 or 3).  The denominator must be a positive integer, a negative integer, or a bignum, and must not equal 0.  The rational number need not be in lowest terms.
</p><p>

A CBOR decoder can treat data items with tag 30 that don't meet the criteria above as an error, but this specification doesn't define how a CBOR implementation ought to behave in this case.  Section 3.4 of RFC 7049 (ref. 1) details this kind of error-handling behavior.
</p><p>
  
A rational number with a denominator of 1 can be serialized to an integer with the same value (for example, to major type 0 or a bignum), but this behavior is not required.
</p><p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
The following example shows how the rational number 1/3 is encoded.
</p>
<pre>
    d8 1e      ---- Tag 30
       82      ---- Array length 2
          01   ---- 1
          03   ---- 3
</pre>
